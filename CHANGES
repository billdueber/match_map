      Simplified build process
2.0.0 !!!! THIS IS  A BIG, BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE !!!!
      MatchMap now always returns an array (possibly empty) 
      Changed to use 1.8/1.9 specific code to simplify things;
1.1.1 Fixed Proc; removed dependence on 1.9
1.1.0 Add a different optimize method and benchmarking code; now 1.9 only
1.0.0 Improve documentation and bump version to 1.0.0
0.5.0 Change underlying structures so return order is guaranteed; lost optimize in the process
